# The Free Flight Site
---

The Free Flight Site is a full stack web application designed to showcase and facilitate my evolution as a developer.

It utilizes a PostrgreSQL database, accessed using SQLAlchemy in a Python Flask Environment, all displayed to the client in a sleek, intuitive react/redux powered UI 

The applications Images are hosted via AWS, and I am excited to expand on the GoogleMapsAPI integration, as of now the ElevationAPI was the trickiest to integrate but increases the functionality of the site such that it was worth it.
