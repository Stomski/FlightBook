# in this read me I will be documenting my process and the difficulties I encounter while assembling this site

### AWS

i built an aws bucket, and created a user

### DEPLOYED TO RENDER

i deployed a poorly assembled app to render, it doesnt really work but it is built and on there

### building my tables, migrating and creating my DB

so this is where im at, ive done this before lets do it. i have my schema designed, although im sure changes will have to be made

going to analyze thuroughly the models in my most recent project,
seems as if i want to create the models, then relationships, migrate and upgrade the DB, and then seed

so in that vein, models has the db, the init, and all my models

starting from user, making my models
next making flights
next sites
now comments, reviews,

on to relationships

made most relationships, no join tables, gonna move on to some seeders , get some chat gpt action and some actual colorado PG sites
